Please read the following:
--------------------------

* Woodworking can be dangerous, and in particular, using a router or other tools
to cut joints is dangerous.  You can loose your eyesight, fingers, and suffer
other serious, even fatal, injuries.
* The authors of pyRouterJig are not responsible for any injury,
death, or financial loss that could conceivably be caused by using
pyRouterJig.
* As a user of pyRouterJig, only you are responsible for using the
output of pyRouterJig safely and responsibly.
* The templates and patterns for joints that pyRouterJig  generate are
simply suggestions for joints.  There is no implication that the joints can be
safely cut with your tools (even if you have a Festool router).
* You are solely responsible for operating your tools in a safe manner.  If
you feel pyRouterJig could conceivably encourage you to operate your tools in
an unsafe manner, don\'t use pyRouterJig.
* pyRouterJig does no stress or strength
analysis of the joints it generates (although we would happily accept code
changes that would do such analysis).
* There is no implication of any
particular joint\'s strength.  The joint may fail, even if you glue it up
properly. pyRouterJig is not responsible for joint failures.
* There is no guarantee that pyRouterJig is accurate, or even generates a
feasible joint.  Errors in pyRouterJig might result a joint pattern that does
not fit and destroy your otherwise perfect woodworking project.
* In summary, if you believe, or you believe that your survivors might believe,
that it is even remotely possible that pyRouterJig could cause you and your
family serious bodily injury or death, break your tools, or ruin your
woodworking project, do not use pyRouterJig.
